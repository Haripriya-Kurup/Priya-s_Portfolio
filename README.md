# Project 1 : FLIGHT DISRUPTION DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM .
# The project aims at building end to end business intelligent system for on time flight performance, analyzing delays and cancellations comparing with weather factors.
# Dataset Used US Filight 2016 to 2018 dataset
# Tools used : SQL , Python,Tableau,Microsoft Azure


# Project 2 : EFFECT OF RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION WITH CROSS VALIDATION ON MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR DIFFERENT DATASETS.
# This paper focus on comparing the performance of different classification methods on two different datasets. 
# The two datasets that are taken are the liver disease and the PIMA diabetes data.
# The proposed model uses recursive Feature Elimination with cross validation (RFECV) to select the vital features that affects the model.
# The Five different machine learning algorithms used this case study are Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K- nearest Neighbor (KNN). 
# The F1-measure, Precision and accuracy was computed to evaluate the performance of the model. 
# KNN has the highest precision score of 89% on diabetes dataset and 100% by SVM on liver disease dataset. 
# The model with RFECV took less execution time when compared to the model without RFECV.

# Project 3 : POST CODE ANALYSIS
# The aim of the project is to know what lead sources are the most successful and which postcode areas that the client  should focus on.
# Tools Used : Advanced Excel and PBI
